            <h2>Presentation 1</h2>
            <p class="presenter">Professor Manuel Perez Garcia (Shanghai Jiao Tong University)</p>
            <p class="presentation-title">"Global Encounters between China and Europe: The 'Power Paradox Theory' and Big Data Mining Applied to the Analysis of Autocratic States, 1680–1840"</p>
            
            <p>The first speaker was historian Professor Manuel Perez Garcia, whose presentation was titled "Global Encounters between China and Europe: The 'Power Paradox Theory' and Big Data Mining Applied to the Analysis of Autocratic States, 1680–1840".</p>
            
            <p>Garcia attempted to address an old question surrounding the "Great Divergence" and "Reversal of Fortune": "Why, from approximately the 18th century onwards, did Western European countries (especially Britain) rapidly surpass China—which had previously led globally in economic and other aspects—and enter industrialization and modernization first? And why did China fall into relative decline during the Qing Dynasty?"</p>
        
            <p>Garcia did not directly name representative theoretical models from institutional economics. I believe it's worth adding that this issue in mainstream academia is often dominated by "institution-centered theory," with perhaps the most influential being the institutional model proposed by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson (AJR) in their book "Why Nations Fail." They attribute countries' development paths to differences in adopting "inclusive institutions" or "extractive institutions," arguing that while the latter may extract social resources in the short term, they cannot achieve national development and prosperity in the long run. Applying this model to the decline of the Qing Dynasty would mean explaining it as a natural result of "extractive institutions"—the state declining due to exploitation of people's wealth.</p>
        
            <p>Although I hold Acemoglu in the highest regard and admiration, as Garcia pointed out, the AJR model and its explanatory approach are difficult to sustain in the case of the Qing Dynasty, revealing limitations in its empirical framework within specific historical contexts. The 18th century Qing Empire had a highly prosperous commercial market that was not only active in consumption but also absorbed more than two-thirds of global American silver. Against this backdrop, simply categorizing it as an "extractive institution" seems not only arbitrary but also ignores the complex structural contradictions behind it. Garcia accordingly suggests that the key issue is not whether the institutional form is "inclusive" but whether the state can establish effective fiscal extraction and transformation capabilities. As Joseph Schumpeter and Martin Daunton emphasized, the rise of modern states often depends on the expansion of tax capacity and the establishment of institutional fiscal systems. Garcia's analysis is therefore closer to Francis Fukuyama's three-dimensional framework of "rule of law—state capacity—accountability," except that he focuses on the "state capacity" dimension and reaches conclusions about China's case that are drastically different from Fukuyama's.</p>
            
            <p>Equally noteworthy is that Garcia's explanation for "why Western Europe achieved modernization and rise first" also differs from the institutional advantages or endogenous development logic emphasized by traditional modernization theory. He proposes that Western Europe's success should be reexamined from the perspective of colonialism: its strength did not merely stem from the "superiority" of internal institutions but relied to a greater extent on resource capital accumulation and overseas power acquired through overseas expansion since the 18th century.</p>
            
            <p>On the basis of continuous input of foreign wealth, Western European countries built fiscal infrastructure centered on customs, ports, and financial systems domestically, gradually realizing the transformation of industrial capacity and military power. Meanwhile, Western European countries established an unequal colonial system at the international level to systematically oppress and exploit colonies, which was one of the important external factors leading to China's relative decline in the 19th century.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps Garcia's most inspiring point is reflected in his profound critique of research methodology. He points out the widespread use of "bubble estimation" in institutional economic history, comparative politics, and political economy for data processing: to construct empirical econometric models that are formally continuous and technically usable for regression analysis, researchers often rely heavily on estimated data. This type of construction, lacking authenticity and verifiability, might be tolerable in the context of political science pursuing model operation and theoretical deduction, but is unacceptable in historical research emphasizing evidence rigor and source basis. Obviously, GDP itself is a product of post-war modern state governance logic, and forcibly applying this concept to 18th century Qing China not only lacks explanatory power but also tends to obscure more historical realities. For this reason, Garcia emphasizes that historical data should be restored from real archives, and "no data" itself is a historical fact that should not be filled with estimated data. Chow also pointed out during the final Q&A session: the use of such extrapolated data can at best weaken the robustness of empirical research and at worst fundamentally shake the causal inference framework in political economy.</p>

        <div class="presentation">
            <h2>Presentation 2</h2>
            <p class="presenter">Terry Su (Chairman of Lulu Derivation Publishing House and Think Tank)</p>
            <p class="presentation-title">"Euro-Russian Duo: China's View?"</p>
            
            <p>The second presentation was delivered by Terry Su, Chairman of Lulu Derivation Publishing House and Think Tank, titled "Euro-Russian Duo: China's View?" From the perspective of a Chinese observer, he offered a policy recommendation to Europe: to achieve a truly stable and balanced international order, Europe must break away from the US-led ideological structure and establish an inclusive relationship with Russia to achieve true European integration, thereby jointly constructing a new global order of multipolar coexistence.</p>
            
            <p>Su believes that Europe currently faces three fundamental problems:</p>
            <p><strong>First</strong>, European integration "has always excluded Russia." Su emphasizes: "Russia has always been part of Europe—both culturally and geographically." In his view, Europe has attempted five major integrations throughout history: medieval Christianization, the Holy Roman Empire led by the Habsburg dynasty, Napoleon's empire in the early 19th century, the establishment of the European Union in the late 20th century, and current integration efforts against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war. However, all five integration attempts invariably excluded Russia and ultimately failed to achieve comprehensive, lasting integration, thereby preventing Europe from truly becoming a powerful global leading force.</p>
            <p><strong>Second</strong>, ideologization is the deep-rooted cause of integration failure. The current institutional opposition between the EU and Russia does not merely stem from geopolitical or security interest conflicts but is rooted in ideological structures. Su believes that Western European liberalism has long maintained an exclusionary attitude toward "non-democratic regimes," constraining Euro-Russian relations within a framework of "moral superiority vs. inferiority" and making it difficult to establish stable cooperation mechanisms.</p>
            <p><strong>Third</strong>, Europe's security and political structure has long been dominated by the United States. Although Europe gradually integrated economically after World War II, its security system and political discourse remains firmly embedded in US-led frameworks—including the NATO military alliance and the dollar-dominated financial system. Su points out that this dependency constrains the development of Europe's autonomous strategic capabilities.</p>
            
            <p>Therefore, drawing on Jeremy Bentham's "fiction theory," Su proposes that from what he calls "fictional realism," an inclusive vision of European integration with Russia should serve as the basis for practical advancement. He advocates that Europe should abandon Cold War thinking and exclusive integration logic, more inclusively incorporating Russia into its security and economic architecture; simultaneously, Europe should actively promote strategic autonomy, as advocated by Macron and Merkel, gradually moving away from dependence on "Pax Americana." Only on this basis can Europe achieve true strategic autonomy and work with China to promote a multipolar balanced global order to counterbalance the US-led unipolar hegemonic system.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, despite Su claiming to have earned his bachelor's degree from Peking University and his master's from Oxford University, and despite using many flowery phrases and highly academic terminology in his presentation, in my view, most of his arguments not only lack academic rigor but are even somewhat questionable. Take his assertion that "Europe has experienced five integrations" as an example. First, "integration" is largely a Westphalian concept, emphasizing modern sovereign states voluntarily ceding part of their sovereignty to establish supranational governance structures based on public purposes. Whether the "Christian world," the Holy Roman Empire, or Napoleon's vision of a "unified Europe," these are essentially European unifications dominated by single powers: the first based on divine right logic, the Holy Roman Empire on dynastic imperatives, and the Napoleonic Wars on nation-state hegemonic pursuits. These historical forms were clearly exclusive and coercive for other European countries or royal entities, making them difficult to fit the concept of "European integration" with its cooperative nature and liberal character. More debatable is Su's assertion that "each integration excluded Russia and therefore failed to successfully unify Europe," which seems overly simplistic and lacks historical depth.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps most questionable is Su's proposed "fictional realism" policy recommendation. He claims: "Europe should view political ideas that do not yet exist as reality and promote them accordingly," attempting to give theoretical legitimacy to his vision through Jeremy Bentham's "fiction theory."</p>
            
            <p>However, this approach precisely reveals Su's shallow and highly instrumentalized understanding of academic theory. As a jurist and philosopher, Bentham's "fiction theory" was intended to reveal and avoid ambiguous or loosely defined political and legal terms through logical clarification and critical analysis, such as "sovereignty" and "state will." This theory aims to clarify existing political or legal phenomena, not provide legitimacy construction for non-existent visions. Su's use of "fictional realism" actually more closely resembles an idealistic constructivist attempt, intending to force reality to change by shaping a beautiful communal consciousness and vision, even if he labels it as "realism."</p>
            
            <p>A more fundamental problem is that Su's argument contains obvious logical issues. His conclusion advocates that Europe should abandon its exclusionary attitude toward Russia, but he neither traces back to why Europe has long maintained distance from Russia historically and realistically, nor does he address the complex reality of whether Russia itself has the capacity or genuine willingness to integrate into the European political community. Such reasoning logic inevitably raises questions: it's like a teacher facing a student's poor performance due to not doing homework, proposing the solution as "making the student enjoy doing homework" without exploring the deeper reasons and obstacles behind the student's resistance to homework. Under such logic, Su's policy recommendations and final conclusions naturally seem untenable and unconvincing.</p>

            <h2>Presentation 3</h2>
            <p class="presenter">Professor Dov Haim Levin (University of Hong Kong)</p>
            <p class="presentation-title">"Diplomatic Whataboutism and Chinese Public Opinion of European and Chinese Actions in Africa"</p>
            
            <p>The third speaker was Professor Dov Haim Levin from the University of Hong Kong, who is also Chow's co-author. He discussed their collaborative research findings on "Diplomatic Whataboutism and Chinese Public Opinion of European and Chinese Actions in Africa."</p>
            
            <p>The concept of whataboutism and the research methodology underpinning their study have already been systematically elaborated in their earlier publication in a top-tier journal, "The Diplomacy of Whataboutism and U.S. Foreign Policy Attitudes," and thus will not be reiterated here. In brief, whataboutism refers to a diplomatic strategy whereby, when criticized, a state does not directly respond to the critique but instead deflects by highlighting the accuser's own shortcomings. This tactic shifts attention away from the original criticism and undermines its legitimacy. For instance, when the United States criticizes China over human rights issues, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs might respond by saying, "How can you criticize us after what you did in Iraq and Afghanistan?"</p>

            <p>The core objective of Dov and Chow's research was to examine whether a government's use of whataboutist rhetoric can enhance domestic public support for the government, and to identify the mechanisms through which such an effect operates.
            
            <p>Their key findings suggest that whataboutism is indeed effective: regardless of whether the criticism originates from friendly or hostile countries, and regardless of whether the counter-critique is directly related to the original issue, whataboutism significantly boosts public approval. This effect is primarily driven through three mechanisms: reducing the credibility of the accuser, enhancing the legitimacy of the targeted government, and satisfying the public's desire for a strong and assertive diplomatic response.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, this research represents a highly mature and methodologically rigorous empirical study, employing diversified empirical strategies and offering strong testing for the six core hypotheses set forth. Both the systematic structure of the analysis and the persuasiveness of the argumentation are impressive, fully demonstrating the authors' solid academic competence and advanced empirical research skills.</p>

            <h2>Presentation 4</h2>
            <p class="presenter">Professor Martin Lockett (UNNC Business School)</p>
            <p class="presentation-title">"The Relevance of the EU Single Market to China: focusing on the Greater Bay Area"</p>
            
            <p>The fourth presentation was delivered by Professor Martin Lockett from our university's Business School, titled "The Relevance of the EU Single Market to China: focusing on the Greater Bay Area."</p>
            
            <p>Lockett aimed to explore whether the experience of the EU Single Market could provide economic development references for China, especially insights for the "Greater Bay Area (GBA)." His core question was: Is it possible for China to create a regional integration mechanism similar to the EU Single Market in the GBA to promote the free movement of labor, capital, goods, and services?</p>
            
            <p>Specifically, Lockett maintained a cautiously optimistic attitude. He believes that the GBA has the potential to become a pioneer in China's institutional regional integration, and the EU's experience is particularly worth learning from in four aspects: mobility of travel, labor mobility, talent attraction, and a path combining institutional coordination and expansion (integration and expansion). The first three concepts are intuitively easy to understand, while the fourth emphasizes the combination of progressive advancement and long-term strategic thinking. Obviously, China has made significant progress in these four dimensions in recent years, promoting the development and vitality of special economic zones.</p>
            
            <p>However, Lockett also pointed out the practical challenges facing GBA regional integration. The primary obstacle lies in the high degree of institutional fragmentation within China, with numerous institutional barriers between different provinces and cities. For example, the household registration system restricts free population movement, while the localized management of social security, medical insurance, education, and other welfare systems also makes cross-regional mobility difficult to achieve. Lockett stated directly: "Sometimes, the barriers between Chinese provinces are more numerous than those between EU countries."</p>
            
            <p>A more fundamental challenge is the issue of national identity. Due to differences in historical and institutional development, Hong Kong and Macau have significant gaps with the mainland in terms of political culture, legal systems, and resident identification. This identity difference makes regional integration not just an issue of economic coordination but also harbors certain political risks—if not handled properly, it could intensify contradictions and affect the sustainability of integration.</p>
            
            <p>From my personal understanding, while Lockett mentioned institutional design, policy coordination, personnel mobility, and other aspects that may have corresponding considerations, the real key to Greater Bay Area integration may not lie in "concepts" and "rules," but in fiscal resources.</p>
            
            <p>Whether promoting labor market integration, unifying social security systems, or building cross-border communication and data sharing platforms, all require large-scale and continuous financial investment to transform institutional ideas into actually operating systems. In comparison, the EU, as a supranational structure, has cost externalization and fiscal sharing mechanisms (member states sharing responsibilities), allowing it to promote institutional integration with controllable fiscal burdens. For China, however, if it were to build a high-level, EU-like "single market" region with internal national leadership, almost all reform costs would need to be borne solely by central and local finances, undoubtedly greatly increasing the difficulty and risk of overall institutional transformation.</p>
